# VolleyDemoWithSingleton
Android volley demo that uses a stringRequest and a Singleton that initializes and runs the request queue
//Steps
1. Check the Android.Manifest file for the internet permissions
2. Check gradle file for the volley library dependacy
3. Check MySingleton class to see how the requests are made, the idea is that it will last for the entire lifetime of the app
4. Check MainActivity.class on the Demo
